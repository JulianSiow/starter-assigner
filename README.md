Starter Assigner was built for my friends and I to randomly assign starter pokemon between the three of us for a group play through of a pokemon game.  

### Technologies Used: 

* JavaScript
* HTML/CSS
* jQuery
* Bootstrap

### Expansion Options:

* Different options for more or less than 3 people
* Allows for repeat pokemon
* Add cutomization to Pokemon cards based on type 
* Clicking submit button multiple cards just appends new cards

### Notable Bugs/To Dos:

* Find Starters button should clear out the previous starters before creating new ones
* Background styling broken on mobile on Galaxy S10+
* Hover effect broken on IPhone 7, add @media query?
* Code cleanup
